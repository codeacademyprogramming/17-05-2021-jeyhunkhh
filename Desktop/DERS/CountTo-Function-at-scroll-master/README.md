CountTo-Function-at-scroll
==========================

This is a combination of CountTo (https://github.com/mhuggins/jquery-countTo) and waypoints.js (http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/) functions.

The main goal of this solution is to enforce"countTo function" to  revel it when the item is at the bottom of the page (if you scroll to this item).
